  <br>
  See the sections below for more detail on your natural roles and some suggestions 
  for <a href="http://www.yourleadershiplegacy.com/assessment/assessment.php#nextsteps"><u>next steps</u></a>.</p>
<h2>Ambassador</h2>
<p>
Ambassadors instinctively know how to handle a variety of situations with grace. They tend to be the people diffusing nasty situations. The ones getting involved in conflicts on behalf of broad constituencies, as opposed for their own benefit. They are apt to be persistent in a gentle way -- to be persuasive and at the same time respectful.<br><br>

An Ambassador, for example, might be someone who can introduce a whole host of people-assessment and development frameworks with the result that employees understand and accept the new order easily. 
</p>
<h2>Advocate</h2>
<p>
Advocates instinctively act as the spokesperson in a group. They tend to be articulate, rational, logical, and persuasive. They also tend to be relentless (in the positive sense of the word), championing ideas or strategic positions. Advocates tend to use both linear and non-linear approaches when they argue a point.<br><br>

Top managers who are natural Ambassadors may do very well at navigating through rough waters. But for Advocates, being in rough waters is part of the reason they revel in their work. (Many Advocates tend to see things in black and white only. Advocates very often need Ambassadors on their senior management teams -- to help them temper their messages and persuade employees to “buy into” their decisions.)</p>
<h2>People Mover</h2>
<p>
Think: Talent-spotter, career-builder, motivator, someone with parental, nurturing qualities. People Movers instinctively take the lead in building teams. They’re also instinctive mentors. They generally have large contact lists; they are always introducing new people to new ideas and new paths. They’re also generally mindful of their employees’ lives outside of work; they view performance through the larger lens of potential.<br><br>

There is a certain “holiday card joy” that comes with being a People Mover; when people continue to update you on their progress because they know you’ll care, even if you have nothing in common with them and are effectively out of touch with them, you know you’re a People Mover.</p>
<h2>Truth-Seeker</h2>
<p>
Think: fairness, good judgment, equalizer, level-headed, process-oriented, scrupulous neutrality, objectivity is the high standard. This is the only role for which there is a “prerequisite;” Truth-Seekers are unfailingly competent in their field; their competence is unquestioned.<br><br>

Truth-Seekers instinctively level the playing field for those in need. They also help people understand new rules and policies. They act to preserve the integrity of processes. They try to identify the root-cause issues, or pivotal issues. They also step in to ensure the just and fair outcome if the process has failed to yield the same.<br><br>

Successful individuals in the Human Resources function are generally natural Truth-Seekers. Truth-Seekers also tend to gravitate towards line-manager positions.</p>
<h2>Creative Builder</h2>
<p>
These individuals are visionaries and entrepreneurs – they are happiest and most driven at the start of things. They instinctively: see new opportunities for new products, new companies; spot niche markets; take ideas and make them real. They’re also often “serial entrepreneurs” over time, even if they remain in one leadership post.<br><br>

Creative Builders instinctively understand that building is not necessarily about invention, but about process of making an invention real. Builders are constantly energized by new ideas, yet they have the staying power to see them through to fruition. <br><br>
The issue is rarely simply the idea; builders aren’t “Hey Dave, what’s your latest scheme?” people. Builders are fascinated with implementation. Real estate developers are often “builders” in this way (beyond the obvious connection); they feel most rewarded when a project gets underway, or is newly completed. <br><br>

Builders sometimes get into trouble if they remain in one place for too long. There are case studies, too numerous to mention, of entrepreneurs whose legacies are negative because they became enmeshed in the day-to-day operations of the companies they created, and didn’t know when it was time to leave. Builders can successfully remain in a single leadership position only if they figure out how to feed their own need for new projects. <br><br>

Here’s an equation to try on yourself if you identify with the role of builder: <br><br>

	Strength of belief in end result + Ability to tolerate the process = Creative Builder <br><br>
	</p>

<h2>Experienced Guide</h2>
<p>
The term “Experienced Guide” conjures up an image of someone very old and wrinkled, with the experience that comes with age. That’s not incorrect, but Experienced Guides don’t have to be old, or necessarily experienced. What they do have to have is an ability to listen, and to put themselves in others’ shoes. They have a way of helping people think through their own problems; they are natural therapists. Often, they are seemingly bottomless wells of information on a diverse range of topics. These are the people who can always be counted on to supply the right quotation or the right historical connection.<br><br>

They are not necessarily mediators, yet the experienced guide is often the person who finds him or herself “in the middle,” with people on both sides of a conflict seeking advice. When a corporate meeting has been particularly stressful or fraught with conflict, the “post-meeting, closed-door meeting” often takes place in the Wise One’s office.<br><br>

Remember the “family lawyer” of old? The person, outside of the family, who knew (and kept) all the family secrets, and was often sought for advice? The experienced guide role naturally lends itself today to the position of minister, counselor, trusted advisor.<br><br>

Renato Tagiuri, emeritus professor at the Harvard Business School, noted that natural “experienced guides” are often found one level down from the top in organizations. They get their greatest satisfaction helping others get through the day and helping others see the bigger picture. They empathize.</p>

<h2><a name="nextsteps"></a>Your Next Steps</h2>

<p>
Your natural role will give you a broad indication of the types of legacies you are building as a leader. With that natural (or "default") role in mind, ask yourself: In what way is my leadership affecting the people who work with and for me? How do I affect the way they work, the way they think, the way they approach a task at work? How does my natural style affect their style?
<br><br>
Try asking these questions in a "broad strokes" kind of way, and then go back and ask them again, with particular situations in mind. Last week's round of performance reviews, for instance, or the most recent staff meeting. How does the way in which you approach things change or steer the way in which others behave? What might you try to accentuate, by a degree or two, to help you build the kind of leadership legacy you would like to? What might you delegate a bit more, or seek other's input (again by a degree or two)? <br><br>

An enhanced understanding of your own natural orientation at work can help you calibrate your leadership, and the dynamics of your organization, more effectively.
